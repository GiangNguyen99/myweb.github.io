    <h1>DIETER GASS is Head of Audi Motorsport.</h1>
    <p>The German who hails from Giessen/Hessen (born in 1963) began his career as a driver of slalom and hill-climb races. In 1991, Gass became champion in the German Renault-elf Trophy. A year earlier, he had successfully finished his engineering degree programme (electromechanical engineering design). At Bugatti, he gathered initial professional experience as an engineer before working at Audi Sport in various projects from 1994 to 2001. In 2012, Dieter Gass returned to Audi after more than ten years in Formula One (Toyota and Lotus) and in 2017 took over the reins from Dr Wolfgang Ullrich.</p>
